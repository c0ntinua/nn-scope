# nn-scope
[UPDATE : I made this before I discovered Raylib, and I hope to get around to making the graphics smoother by updating the plotting functions, etc. But it's still the version of nn-scope that offers the most layers and the most control. ]
Here's a video demo/intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb1aHazMNTI.

This program allows for an interactive, graphical exploration of deep learning in the ultra-simplied context of fitting a real-valued function to a scatterplot. 

You can find versions of nn-scope in JS and C as well, with the latest version (and perhaps the best) written in C : https://github.com/sc0tzwEi/nn-scope-C
